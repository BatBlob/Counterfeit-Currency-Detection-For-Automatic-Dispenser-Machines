# Counterfeit Currency Detection For Automatic Dispenser Machines
Due to advancements in technology, there is an astonishing
amount of fake and counterfeit currency flowing in the world.
To combat this, many counterfeit money detection methods
have been introduced using advanced techniques such as machine learning. This paper focuses on using a very simple
method, i.e automatically extracting 5 visual features of the
note and verifying them using an algorithm. This does not
require any extensive hardware or machinery present and can
be easily implemented in many places such as vending machines, automated teller machines and dispensers.
